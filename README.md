# Breaking Point Mod

Breaking Point Mod is a total conversion mod for Arma 3. Source is provided for the community to improve the mod and host their own servers. Released under the [Arma Public Share Like Licence](https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike) (APL-SA).

## Objectives & Goals

* Provide a better version of the mod for people still playing. While the developers focus work on the standalone version.
* Compatibility with Arma  Updates / New Maps / DLC etc.
* Move Away from Breaking Point Launcher / The Zombie Infection Specific Code & Requirements. This removes a time / money cost and allows the official developers to spend all their time working on the standalone game.
* Intergrate Launcher Features (Legion System, Viewing Faction Points and Stats into the Main Game)
* Cross Platform Support ( Windows, Mac, Linux ) / This allows for hosting dedicated servers on Linux with a cheaper server cost.
* Release a Official Update with all these fixes. Submit a pull request with improvements and we will merge that into the game.

## Conflicts & Problems

* Fragmentation: Everyone using a custom version of Breaking Point and hosting vastly different servers and configurations. If we can work together and merge fixes into Breaking Point as a community.
